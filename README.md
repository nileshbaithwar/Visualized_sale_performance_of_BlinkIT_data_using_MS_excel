# üìä **BlinkIT Sales Analysis Project** 

## üìÇ **Project Overview**

This project leverages an **Excel dataset** that contains retail sales data for various items across multiple outlets. The dataset includes detailed information about product categories, outlet types, item visibility, weight, sales, and customer ratings. The goal of this project is to analyze sales trends, evaluate outlet performance, and understand the impact of item visibility and other attributes on overall sales performance.

## üéØ **Project Goals**

* **Sales Trend Analysis**: Understand how different products perform across various outlets.
* **Outlet Comparison**: Evaluate sales performance across different outlet types (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Type2, etc.).
* **Visibility Impact**: Assess how item visibility correlates with sales.
* **Weight Analysis**: Investigate the relationship between item weight and sales.
* **Outlet Characteristics**: Explore how outlet size and location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) influence sales.

---

## üìä **Key Insights to Explore**

1. **Sales by Product Type**: Identify which product categories (e.g., Fruits and Vegetables, Household, Health and Hygiene) perform the best in terms of sales.
2. **Impact of Visibility**: Compare how products with higher visibility in outlets tend to perform compared to those with lower visibility.
3. **Outlet Type Comparison**: Determine whether Supermarket Type1, Type2, or Type3 outlets drive more sales.
4. **Weight vs Sales**: Examine if item weight influences sales performance.
5. **Sales by Outlet Location**: Assess how Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations affect sales and visibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Software Used**

* **Microsoft Excel**: The dataset is compatible with Excel for analysis.
* **Power Query** (Optional): Can be used for data transformation and cleaning.
* **Excel Formulas**: For aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE), and trend analysis (e.g., correlation between visibility and sales).
* **Charts & Pivot Tables**: For data visualization and summarization.

## üì§ **How to Use the Dataset in Excel**

### 1. **Open the File**

* Download and open the `BlinkIT_Sales_Data.xlsx` file in **Microsoft Excel** or another compatible tool.

### 2. **Data Exploration**

* Review the columns and data types.
* Use Excel's **Filter** feature to sort and segment data by specific columns such as Item Type, Outlet Type, or Rating.

### 3. **Sales Analysis**

* Use **Pivot Tables** to summarize total sales by `Item Type`, `Outlet Type`, or `Outlet Location Type`.
* Create **Charts** (e.g., Bar Charts, Line Graphs) to visualize sales trends across different dimensions (e.g., visibility vs sales, outlet size vs sales).

### 4. **Advanced Analysis (Optional)**

* **Correlation**: Use Excel functions to calculate the correlation between item weight and sales.
* **Ranking**: Use Excel‚Äôs **RANK** function to rank products by sales or rating.

## üîç **Sample Analysis Examples**

1. **Sales Performance by Outlet Type**: Create a Pivot Table to show total sales by Outlet Type (e.g., `Supermarket Type1`, `Supermarket Type2`).
2. **Impact of Item Visibility on Sales**: Plot a scatter plot with `Item Visibility` on the X-axis and `Sales` on the Y-axis to observe any correlations.
3. **Item Weight vs Sales**: Calculate the average sales for each `Item Weight` group and plot the results on a line chart to identify any patterns.
4. **Rating Distribution**: Use a bar chart to show the number of items by their `Rating` score (e.g., how many items have a rating of 5, 4, etc.).
